# Maximizing Productivity with Picture-in-Picture
Imagine balancing a day packed with responsibilities that each demand your attention: watching a crucial live World Cup match or attending a lengthy video conference or monitoring fast-moving stock market data as well as keeping an eye on a toddler through a baby cam, or squeezing in a quick fitness routine via an online guide.
